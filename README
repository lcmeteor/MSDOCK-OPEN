Introduction for MSDOCK
==========================

The MSDOCK program is developed based on AutoDock 4.2.6.

A novel multi-swarm optimization search algorithm, namely multi-swarm
Lamarckian Random Drift Particle Swarm Optimization (MSLRDPSO), 
has been added in MSDOCK. The core part of the MSLRDPSO algorithm
is the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) with a
newly proposed multi-swarm strategy. The Solis and Wets local search
method is also used in MSLRDPSO, applied in a modified implementation,
making it be adapt to the multi-swarm structure.

The key parameter of MSLRDPSO is the number of sub-swarms. The default
setting of this parameter is 2 sub-swarms for docking tasks with torsions
more than 20 and 6 sub-swarms for others. In our related paper, it has
been proved that this parameter setting can make MSDOCK to be better than
several docking programs for flexible ligand docking problems.

The MSLRDPSO algorithm has both serial mode and parallel mode. It should
be noted that the parallel mode of MSLRDPSO is to parallelize single 
docking tasks by using OPENMP, not to run multiple docking jobs in parallel.
In parallel mode, the energy calcualtion part of each single docking task
is run in parallel, and each thread is designed to load one sub-swarm.

Some files associated with the energy function calculation and local
search method has been modified, to make the functions in these files 
to be thread-safe, so that the MSLRDPSO can be run in parallel mode.

The usage for other search methods and the corresponding files originally
contained in AutoDock 4.2.6 is unchanged. Users can still utilize the
other functions of AutoDock 4.2.6 as the original way. For example,
docking by using LGA or SA. 

Note that the proposed MSLRDPSO algorithm is not suppoted by AutoDockTools
(ADT), a graphical user interface for AutoDock. In this version, it can only
be implemented in a command-line usage.

With respect to the docking preparation for MSDOCK, users can still use
AutoGrid. They are contained in the official package of AutoDock 4.2.6, 
can be downloaded from http://autodock.scripps.edu.

For more details about other functions those already contained in AutoDock
4.2.6, please see AutoDock426_README in this package.

===========================
Code download
===========================

 https://github.com/lcmeteor/MSDOCK-OPEN

===========================
Platform
===========================

x86_64Linux2 : 64-bit Intel Linux

Caution: we do not test MSDOCK on all many platforms.
Our experiments are all run on a Ubuntu 16.04 Linux platform

==================================
Building MSDOCK from source code
==================================

Download all the source code files from the web site.

The general process is:

 "cd" to msdock source directory
 ./configure
 make
 make install (optional, this will install msdock and msdock.omp executable)

==================
Usage for MSDOCK
==================

Set the run_mode in .dpf file to be "msdock_run" to call docking using 
MSLRDPSO (default in AutoDock4: ga_run).

The MSLRDPSO in MSDOCK has two modes:
Normal mode (Serial mode): msdock -p file.dpf -l file.dlg
Parallel mode: msdock.omp -p file.dpf -l file.dlg

Some specified parameters for MSLRDPSO can be set manually in the .dpf file 
when using MSLRDPSO. Their short name in the .dpf file and the corresponding 
introductions are listed below:

msdock_run: number of runs by using MSLRDPSO for the docking task
msrd_num_subs: number of sub-swarms (default: 2 for torsions>20 and 6 for others)
msrd_FE_interval: number of function evaluations between two feature exchange methods
    (default: 30*pop_size)
alpha_start: the starting alpha value in MSLRDPSO (default:0.9)
alpha_end: the ending alpha value in MSLRDPSO (default:0.0)
beta_start: the starting beta value in MSLRDPSO (default:1.45)
beta_end: the ending beta value in MSLRDPSO (default: 1.00)
msrd_tvmax: the boundary value for translations of ligand in MSLRDPSO (default:2.0)
msrd_qvmax: the boundary value for quaternions of ligand in MSLRDPSO (default: 1.0)
msrd_rvmax: the boundary value for torsions of ligand in MSLRDPSO (default: 50.0)
msrd_regenerate_at_limit: the way of out-of-boundary process for each particle (default:true)
    if set to true: regenerate a random value within the value range
    if set to false: set the value to be the boundary value

Generally, users can adjust msrd_num_subs and msrd_FE_interval to obtain better
results for a specified docking task, and other parameters do not need to be changed.
The original parameter settings for AutoDock 4.2.6 can also be set in MSDOCK,
see AutoDock4.2_UserGuide.dpf for more details.

It should be noted that in parallel mode each thread is designed to load one
sub-swarms, thus, the set of msrd_num_subs also determines the number of threads
loaded in parallel mode.
