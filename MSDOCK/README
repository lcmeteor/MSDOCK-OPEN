/* Instruction and User Guideline of MSDOCK */


This docking program is modified based on the Autodock 4.2.6

In the this software package, each the modified files has a backup file starting with "ms...",
and the original files are all renamed by adding ".bak" at the end of the filename.
These files are modified to make sure they are thread-safe.

Specifically, "msrdpso_omp_release.cc" is the main implementation of the MSL-RDPSO search algorithm,
and it replace the pso.cc of Autodock 4.2.6.


If you want apply the MSL-RPPSO algorithm to docking problems, modify "ga_run" to "do_pso" in the *.dpf file.

Run MSDOCK:
Serial Mode(1-thread): MSautodock4 -p *.dpf -l *.dlg
Parallel Mode(N-thread): MSautodock4.omp -p *.dpf -l *.dlg 
(N equals to the return value of the "omp_get_thread_num()" function in main.cc)
